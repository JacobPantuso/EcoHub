# Introduction
üå±üåç I'm thrilled to share a project I've been working on for quite some time. My journey with EcoHub began with a deep-seated curiosity about the intricate relationship between human actions and the environment. Motivated by the Apple Student Developer Challenge, I was inspired to start working on something that will carry meaning for years to come.

EcoHub isn't just any side project‚Äîit's my first Swift app bound for the App Store. As a student developer, EcoHub is not just about creating an app; it's aimed at educating individuals about the environmental consequences of their actions and empowering them to make positive changes. 

Working for Toronto Metropolitan University and its partners over the past year has shown me the importance of holding everyone accountable for making a positive impact. 

Through EcoHub, users will have access to valuable insights into their daily habits and how they contribute to environmental issues. From carbon footprints to sustainable lifestyle choices, the app offers practical tips and resources for everyone to play their part in preserving our planet.

# More Information
EcoHub will be available on the App Store later this year as I continue to research this important topic. As always, for any questions or additional information, visit my profile for contact details. Let's continue to work towards a greener, healthier future!
